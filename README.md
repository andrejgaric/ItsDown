It's Down
=========

Android learning code.

The sub-projects do nothing special or secret, all stuff probably is avaiable
at google in a better or nice shape. But i don't like these examples as they
mix alot of stuff. Goal of this collection is to concentrate on the topic. An
app that reads contacts just reads contacts, there is no gui, nothing. The only
feature that is used on top if the topic is androids logging. So if the
contacts are read they will be written to the log and read by logcat.

The sub-projects play around with some Android features:

 - reading and writing contacts in a more java-typical manner (using enumerations)

 - receiving an acting on an intent

 - rescan media / refresh the cache

 - play around with messages

 - read nfc

 - write nfc

 - read qrcode

 - write qrcode

 - play around with a service and it's states

 - play around with tabs and the nice new gui elements

 - using openpgp via aidl

 - read wireless ids

and more will added.

with all projects

 - learning to use gradle

 - learning to use gradle in a multi-library/app project
